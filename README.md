# Journal of Applied Hermeneutics
repo for a TEI encoding and network analysis experiment

### TEI XML files from 2011-2025
These files have been converted from the open access PDF's available through the journal's website: https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/jah/issue/archive
The journal is published by the University of Calgary and was selected because of it's CC BY license which allows the CTL to use its materials without limiting restrictions.

The file formatting should follow the most current TEI guidelines from https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html

# Process Notes
Currently, I am downloading the PDFs from the website and using Yale's Clarity AI platform, which uses GPT4-0, to convert the files to .xml with TEI encoding. There is a program called GROBID that should allow PDFs to more reliably be converted to TEI docs, but I have been unable to run it properly on my computer. 

The two files I've already converted have been double checked against the original articles.

I plan to comb through and code for concepts/authors/etc., and then use Leafwriter to streamline the process.

# Open Issues
- Which LLM to use? Paid version?
- What kind of encoding categories are we looking for?
- How to preserve footnotes?
